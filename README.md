# Grav CMS Deployment on Kubernetes Using OpenEBS

## What?
Grav is a flat file CMS that makes it a great choice for a blog or website to run on a resource constrained cluster.  By using OpenEBS underneath it to handle fault tolerance of the data, you can deploy a resilient, easy to use blog quite quickly.  As an added benefit, it also has a Github-sync plugin so you can use a Gitops flow to publish pages or layouts to your site.  Gitops is handy as it provides a structured, easy to use workflow for publishing content or making changes to your site.  Not to mention, by keeping everything in git, your data is even more resilient!
